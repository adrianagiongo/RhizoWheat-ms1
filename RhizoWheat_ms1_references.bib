   abstract = {The overall objective of this study is to examine the application of arable weeds as indicator organisms of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems to evaluate species conservation effects of management practices. Both investigations of interactions between weeds with heterotrophic consumers and strong overall correlations between the number of weed species and the total species diversity indicate that arable weeds are "key species", the loss of which leads to serious changes in the remaining biocoenosis via habitat and food chain relations. The assessment of the value of management measures for species conservation presupposes a strong relation of target organisms to land use practice. In arable fields, the high percentage of dormant seeds reduces the relevance of single cultivation measures against weed populations and emphasizes the significance of long lasting management including cultivation systems, crop rotations, or field edge effects. A comparison of the number of weed species found at different times and frequencies of sampling indicates - especially in herbicide treated fields - the importance of two recording times - one before the application and one before harvest. This ensures a better estimation of the total species spectrum. To evaluate plant species diversity in fields the number of characteristic arable weeds is proposed. In contrast to the total number of species, the typical arable weeds do not include species frequently occurring outside fields. Thus, several highly noxious species like Cirsium arvense, Elymus repens and Galium aparine are not positively valued. Differences in rarity and usefulness could lead to a more sophisticated evaluation of single weed species and the species spectrum. The use of different number of species as threshold values for different soil types cannot be recommended, however. Programs which fund the results of management necessitate control measures. In Germany, which has an arable area of 11.8 million ha and an estimated average field size of 4 ha, 300 000 sites must be controlled per year when 10% of the farmers were to participate in a corresponding program. Calculating costs of € 50 per site, which includes two vegetation relevés, € 15 million have to be spent each year. Another possibility to increase agro-biodiversity are programs which pay for the application of specific management practices (reduced fertilization, tillage, and weed control, measures of crop selection and rotation) or management systems like organic farming. As the corresponding control is less time consuming such programs are less expansive. Their positive effects on biodiversity are less specific and less reliable, however. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of growing wheat as first and second wheat after oilseed rape, as well as monoculture in a long-term field experiment over three years on (i) aboveground biomass formation, root development and nutrient acquisition during the growing season, (ii) take-all occurrence, and (iii) grain yield and yield components. Subsoil root length density of winter wheat was significantly higher after oilseed rape as pre-crop than after wheat, which was independent of take-all occurrence. Differences in wheat aboveground biomass occurred at early growth stages and were persistent until harvest. Grain yield loss correlated well with take-all disease severity in a wet year but yield differences among crop rotational positions occurred also in a dry year without visible fungal infection. Thus, an effect of the crop rotational position of wheat beyond take-all disease pressure can be assumed. Overall, wheat root length density might be the key to understand wheat biomass formation and grain yield in different crop rotational positions.},

The aims of this study were to analyze if (i) the crop rotational position of winter wheat causes differences in soil structure at the beginning of the growing season and (ii) the soil structure is related to differences in wheat biomass formation by this date. Different soil structural properties under winter wheat as well as total aboveground biomass of wheat grown in different crop rotational positions (monoculture, first, second and third wheat after oilseed rape) were investigated in two long-term field experiments with contrasting soil texture. At both field sites, no significant effect of the crop rotational position in any of the analyzed soil structural parameters was found. Wheat biomass in spring was on average 54% higher for wheat grown after oilseed rape compared to second and third wheat after oilseed rape or monoculture. In conclusion, growth reduction of wheat cultivated after wheat was not linked to soil structure as measured in spring.},

When studying plant root microbiome assembly, it is typical to sample at the whole plant root system scale. However, sampling at these relatively large spatial scales may hinder the observability of intermediate processes. To study the relative importance of these processes, we employed millimetre-scale sampling of the cell elongation zone of individual roots. Both the rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbiomes were examined in fibrous and taproot model systems, represented by wheat and faba bean, respectively. Like others, we found that the plant root microbiome assembly is mainly driven by plant selection. However, based on variability between replicate millimetre-scale samples and comparisons with randomized null models, we infer that either priority effects during early root colonization or variable selection among replicate plant roots also determines root microbiome assembly.},

Soil microbial communities are key players in ecosystem processes and are intimately linked to crop productivity and health. Thus a better understanding of how farming practices affect soil microbiota is needed in order to promote sustainable agriculture. The long-term field trial in Bernburg (Germany) established in 1992 provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of i) the crop (maize vs. rapeseed) preceding the actual winter wheat culture, ii) tillage practice (mouldboard plough vs. cultivator tillage) and iii) standard nitrogen (N)-fertilization intensity with application of growth regulators and fungicides (intensive) compared to reduced N-fertilization without growth regulators and fungicides (extensive). We hypothesized that these different farming practices affect the soil prokaryotic community structures with consequences for their functional potential. Total community-DNA was extracted directly from soils sampled at wheat harvest. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from total community-DNA revealed a significant effect of tillage practice and the preceding crop on prokaryotic community structures, whereas the influence of N-fertilization intensity was marginal. A number of differentially abundant prokaryotic genera and their predicted functions between mouldboard plough vs. cultivator tillage as well as between different preceding crops were identified. Compared to extensive N-fertilization, intensive N-fertilization resulted in higher abundances of bacterial but not of archaeal amoA genes, that are involved in ammonia oxidation. Our data suggest that long-term farming strategies differently shape the soil prokaryotic community structure and functions, which should be considered when evaluating agricultural management strategies regarding their sustainability, soil health and crop performance.},

Despite research on the topic, its causality remains unclear. In a split-root experiment, we grew ARD-susceptible ‘M26’ apple rootstocks in different substrate combinations (+ARD: ARD soil; -ARD: gamma-irradiated ARD soil; and Control: soil with no apple history). We investigated the microbial community composition by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (bacteria and archaea) along the soil–root continuum (bulk soil, rhizosphere and rhizoplane). Significant differences in microbial community composition and structure were found between +ARD and -ARD or +ARD and Control along the soil–root continuum, even for plants exposed simultaneously to two different substrates (-ARD/+ARD and Control/+ARD). The substrates in the respective split-root compartment defined the assembly of root-associated microbial communities, being hardly influenced by the type of substrate in the respective neighbor compartment. Root-associated representatives from Actinobacteria were the most dynamic taxa in response to the treatments, suggesting a pivotal role in ARD. Altogether, we evidenced an altered state of the microbial community in the +ARD soil, displaying altered alpha- and beta-diversity, which in turn will also impact the normal development of apple rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbiota (dysbiosis), concurring with symptom appearance.},

   abstract = {There is a trend world-wide to grow crops in short rotation or in monoculture, particularly in conventional agriculture. This practice is becoming more prevalent due to a range of factors including economic market trends, technological advances, government incentives, and retailer and consumer demands. Land-use intensity will have to increase further in future in order to meet the demands of growing crops for both bioenergy and food production, and long rotations may not be considered viable or practical. However, evidence indicates that crops grown in short rotations or monoculture often suffer from yield decline compared to those grown in longer rotations or for the first time. Numerous factors have been hypothesised as contributing to yield decline, including biotic factors such as plant pathogens, deleterious rhizosphere microorganisms, mycorrhizas acting as pathogens, and allelopathy or autotoxicity of the crop, as well as abiotic factors such as land management practices and nutrient availability. In many cases, soil microorganisms have been implicated either directly or indirectly in yield decline. Although individual factors may be responsible for yield decline in some cases, it is more likely that combinations of factors interact to cause the problem. However, evidence confirming the precise role of these various factors is often lacking in field studies due to the complex nature of cropping systems and the numerous interactions that take place within them. Despite long-term knowledge of the yield-decline phenomenon, there are few tools to counteract it apart from reverting to longer crop rotations or break crops. Alternative cropping and management practices such as double-cropping or inter-cropping, tillage and organic amendments may prove valuable for combating some of the negative effects seen when crops are grown in short rotation. Plant breeding continues to be important, although this does require a specific breeding target to be identified. This review identifies gaps in our understanding of yield decline, particularly with respect to the complex interactions occurring between the different components of agro-ecosystems, which may well influence food security in the 21 st Century. © 2011 The Authors.

In this review, recent studies on the influence of the two factors, plant species and soil type, on rhizosphere-associated microbial communities are discussed. Root exudates and the response of microorganisms to the latter as well as to root morphology were shown to shape rhizosphere microbial communities. All studies revealed that soil is the main reservoir for rhizosphere microorganisms. Many secrets of microbial life in the rhizosphere were recently uncovered due to the enormous progress in molecular and microscopic tools.

   abstract = {Background: One promise of the recently presented microbiome definition suggested that, in combination with unifying concepts and standards, microbiome research could be important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in various microbiota. With this commentary we want to further elaborate this suggestion, because we noticed specific signatures in microbiota affected by the Anthropocene. Results: Here, we discuss this based on a review of available literature and our own research targeting exemplarily the plant microbiome. It is not only crucial for plants themselves but also linked to planetary health. We suggest that different human activities are commonly linked to a shift of diversity and evenness of the plant microbiota, which is also characterized by a decrease of host specificity, and an increase of r-strategic microbes, pathogens, and hypermutators. The resistome, anchored in the microbiome, follows this shift by an increase of specific antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms as well as an increase of plasmid-associated resistance genes. This typical microbiome signature of the Anthropocene is often associated with dysbiosis and loss of resilience, and leads to frequent pathogen outbreaks. Although several of these observations are already confirmed by meta-studies, this issue requires more attention in upcoming microbiome studies. Conclusions: Our commentary aims to inspire holistic studies for the development of solutions to restore and save microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning as well as the closely connected planetary health.

   abstract = {Aims: Temperate alley-cropping agroforestry systems maintain agricultural production while offering several environmental benefits. Central benefits of agroforestry systems such as the ‘safety-net’-role of the trees for leached nutrients are mainly due to processes occurring below the soil surface: the subsoil. Microorganisms in the subsoil may play a key role in the ‘safety-net’-function as they can improve the capturing and uptake of nutrients by the trees. Systematic investigations of microbial communities in temperate agroforestry systems, however, are restricted to topsoil. Methods: We quantified bacteria, fungi, and functional groups of microorganisms in the topsoil and subsoil of two alley-cropping systems using real-time PCR. Topsoil and subsoil samples were collected in the tree rows and at multiple distances from the trees within the crop rows of the agroforestry systems as well as at an adjacent monoculture cropland. Results: Microbial population size decreased with soil depth likely due to limited resource availability in subsoil. Tree rows in agroforestry systems not only promote soil microbial populations in both the topsoil and subsoil but the promotion also extends gradually into the crop rows of the systems. The promotion of microorganisms through trees is stronger in subsoil than topsoil, pointing at more intense resource scarcity in the subsoil than topsoil. Conclusions: We propose that tree root-derived resources and root litter, which are scarce in agricultural subsoils, triggered the strong positive response of the subsoil community to the trees. Finally, we provide initial evidence that subsoil microorganisms contribute to the ‘safety-net’-role of the trees in agroforestry systems.},

The phylogenetic composition of these communities is defined by relatively few bacterial phyla, including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. A synthesis of available data suggests a two-step selection process by which the bacterial microbiota of roots is differentiated from the surrounding soil biome. Rhizodeposition appears to fuel an initial substrate-driven community shift in the rhizosphere, which converges with host genotype-dependent fine-tuning of microbiota profiles in the selection of root endophyte assemblages. Substrate-driven selection also underlies the establishment of phyllosphere communities but takes place solely at the immediate leaf surface. Both the leaf and root microbiota contain bacteria that provide indirect pathogen protection, but root microbiota members appear to serve additional host functions through the acquisition of nutrients from soil for plant growth. Thus, the plant microbiota emerges as a fundamental trait that includes mutualism enabled through diverse biochemical mechanisms, as revealed by studies on plant growth-promoting and plant health-promoting bacteria. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews.

   abstract = {Background: Plant roots assemble microbial communities both inside the roots and in the rhizosphere, and these root-associated microbiomes play pivotal roles in plant nutrition and productivity. Although it is known that increased synthetic fertilizer input in Chinese farmlands over the past 50 years has resulted in not only increased yields but also environmental problems, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how crops under elevated nutrient input shape root-associated microbial communities, especially through adjusting the quantities and compositions of root metabolites and exudates. Methods: The compositions of bacterial and fungal communities from the roots and rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under four levels of long-term inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilization were characterized at the tillering, jointing and ripening stages. The root-released organic carbon (ROC), organic acids in the root exudates and soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil active carbon (SAC) in the rhizosphere were quantified. Results: ROC levels varied dramatically across wheat growth stages and correlated more with the bacterial community than with the fungal community. Rhizosphere SOC and SAC levels were elevated by long-term N fertilization but varied only slightly across growth stages. Variation in the microbial community structure across plant growth stages showed a decreasing trend with N fertilization level in the rhizosphere. In addition, more bacterial and fungal genera were significantly correlated in the jointing and ripening stages than in the tillering stage in the root samples. A number of bacterial genera that shifted in response to N fertilization, including Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Devosia, correlated significantly with acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid levels. Conclusions: Our results indicate that both plant growth status and N input drive changes in the microbial community structure in the root zone of wheat. Plant growth stage demostrated a stronger influence on bacterial than on fungal community composition. A number of bacterial genera that have been described as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) responded positively to N fertilization, and their abundance correlated significantly with the organic acid level, suggesting that the secretion of organic acids may be a strategy developed by plants to recruit beneficial microbes in the root zone to cope with high N input. These results provide novel insight into the associations among increased N input, altered carbon availability, and shifts in microbial communities in the plant roots and rhizosphere of intensive agricultural ecosystems.},

The abundance and richness of diazotrophs were greater the higher the fertilization level in the mulched treatments, whereas in the nonmulched treatments (NSMs), richness was lowest with the highest N fertilization level. The abundance and α-diversity of diazotrophs correlated with most of the soil properties but not with pH. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Azospirillum, Bacillus, and Geobacter were higher in the NSMs and those of Pseudacidovorax, Skermanella, Azospira, Paraburkholderia, Azotobacter, Desulfovibrio, Klebsiella, and Pelomonas in the mulched treatments. The differences in community composition between the mulched and the NSMs were associated with differences in soil temperature and soil organic carbon and available potassium contents and C:N ratio. Overall, straw mulching and N fertilization were associated with changes in diazotroph community composition and higher abundance of nifH gene in alkaline purple soils.},

   abstract = {It has been established that maize/soybean intercropping can improve nitrogen use efficiency. However, few studies have addressed how maize/soybean intercropping affects nitrogen-fixing bacterial diversity and N fixation efficiency of intercropped soybean. In this study, nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities, N fixation efficiency, and their relationships with soil properties under three nitrogen fertilization application rates (N0 0 kg/ha, N1 40 kg/ha, N2 80 kg/ha) were explored through field experiments. Nitrogen fixation and nitrogen-fixing bacteria diversity were assessed using 15N natural abundance, Illumina high-throughput sequencing, and nifH (nitrogen fixation) gene copies quantification in the rhizosphere soil of intercropped soybean. The results showed that nitrogen application rates significantly decreased the nitrogen-fixing bacteria diversity, nitrogen fixation efficiency, and nifH gene copies in the rhizosphere soil. Nitrogen fixation efficiency, nodule number, and dry weight of intercropped soybean were highest in the N0 treatment, and nitrogen fixation was the highest in the N1 treatment. The nitrogen-fixing efficiency in N0, N1, and N2 treatments increased by 69%, 59%, and 42% and the nodule number of soybean was 10%, 22%, and 21%, respectively, compared with monocultures. The soybean nitrogen-fixing bacteria diversity in intercropping under N0 and N1 treatments significantly increased compared with monocultures. There was a significant positive correlation between soil nifH gene copies and N fixation efficiency and a negative correlation with soil available nitrogen. Bradyrhizobium abundance in soybean rhizosphere soil decreased significantly with the increase in nitrogen application rates and was significantly correlated with soil AN (available nitrogen) and pH content in the soybean rhizosphere. These results help us to understand the mechanisms by which nitrogen use efficiency was improved, and nitrogen fertilizer could be reduced in legume/Gramineae intercropping, which is important to improve the sustainability of agricultural production.},

No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly activated during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities.},

   abstract = {The quantity of grass-root exudates varies by season, suggesting temporal shifts in soil microbial community composition and activity across a growing season. We hypothesized that bacterial community and nitrogen cycle-associated prokaryotic gene expressions shift across three phases of the growing season. To test this hypothesis, we quantified gene and transcript copy number of nitrogen fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA, hao, nxrB), denitrification (narG, napA, nirK, nirS, norB, nosZ), dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (nrfA), and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (hzs, hdh) using the pre-optimized Nitrogen Cycle Evaluation (NiCE) chip. Bacterial community composition was characterized using V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene, and PICRUSt2 was used to draw out functional inferences. Surprisingly, the nitrogen cycle genes and transcript quantities were largely stable and unresponsive to seasonal changes. We found that genes and transcripts related to ammonia oxidation and denitrification were different for only one or two time points across the seasons (p < 0.05). However, overall, the nitrogen cycling genes did not show drastic variations. Similarly, the bacterial community also did not vary across the seasons. In contrast, the predicted functional potential was slightly low for May and remained constant for other months. Moreover, soil chemical properties showed a seasonal pattern only for nitrate and ammonium concentrations, while ammonia oxidation and denitrification transcripts were strongly correlated with each other. Hence, the results refuted our assumptions, showing stability in N cycling and bacterial community across growing seasons in a natural grassland.},

   abstract = {Plants depend upon beneficial interactions between roots and microbes for nutrient availability, growth promotion, and disease suppression. High-throughput sequencing approaches have provided recent insights into root microbiomes, but our current understanding is still limited relative to animal microbiomes. Here we present a detailed characterization of the root-associated microbiomes of the crop plant rice by deep sequencing, using plants grown under controlled conditions as well as field cultivation at multiple sites. The spatial resolution of the study distinguished three root-associated compartments, the endosphere (root interior), rhizoplane (root surface), and rhizosphere (soil close to the root surface), each of which was found to harbor a distinct microbiome. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, microbiome composition varied with soil source and genotype. In field conditions, geographical location and cultivation practice, namely organic vs. conventional, were factors contributing to microbiome variation. Rice cultivation is a major source of global methane emissions, and methanogenic archaea could be detected in all spatial compartments of field-grown rice. The depth and scale of this study were used to build coabundance networks that revealed potential microbial consortia, some of which were involved in methane cycling. Dynamic changes observed during microbiome acquisition, as well as steady-state compositions of spatial compartments, support a multistep model for root microbiome assembly from soil wherein the rhizoplane plays a selective gating role. Similarities in the distribution of phyla in the root microbiomes of rice and other plants suggest that conclusions derived from this study might be generally applicable to land plants.},

   abstract = {Beneficial bacteria associated with agricultural crops may potentially increase crop productivity and health. However, during various plant developmental processes, shifts in the diversity and function of bacterial communities often occur. This study investigated the diversity of bacterial communities associated with the rhizosphere, roots, and aboveground plant organs of wheat and canola at stem elongation, flowering, and ripening stages. The growth-chamber experiment consisted of wheat and canola grown in Orthic Brown Chernozem Calcic Kastanozem and Orthic Black Calcic Chernozem soils from agricultural fields in Saskatchewan, Canada. Rhizosphere bacterial communities of wheat and canola were mainly influenced by soil characteristics, whereas a specific root endophytic community was associated with each crop species. These results suggest that each crop may select distinct root bacterial endophytes from the rhizosphere. Bacteria associated with aboveground plant organs exhibited high variability among crop species and soils. The most abundant bacterial genera associated with the rhizosphere of the crops included Gemmatimonas, Solirubrobacter, and Nocardioides, as well as unclassified genera of families Commamonadaceae, Chitinophagaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae. Other genera (e.g., Stenotrophomonas, Streptomyces, and Variovorax) were predominant in wheat roots, whereas species of Lentzea and Pantoea were the most abundant root endophytes detected in canola. Bacterial communities associated with aboveground organs consisted mostly of species of Corynebacterium and Pseudomonas, and unclassified members of the family Enterobacteriacaeae. This study also revealed that plant growth stages can modulate the diversity of rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria. The influence of plant growth stages on the bacterial microbiome associated with wheat and canola was crop and organ specific.},

A database of 96 profiles was compiled and root distribution pattern were fitted to a modified logistic dose response curve for 11 temperate crops. A slight linear decrease between the root mass: length distribution ratio and the soil depth was found for monocotyledons while an exponential decrease with depth was found for dicotyledons. These results indicated that roots were thicker at upper soil layers with the effect much larger for dicotyledons. The estimated depth at which 50% of total root was accumulated for different crops varied from 8 cm to 20 cm. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) showed the deepest rooting profile with a fitted maximum rooting depth (dmax) of 177 cm but another perennial, fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.), had the shallowest dmax of 78 cm. In general, cereal and pulse crop roots were distributed more evenly in soil profile while more roots were accumulated in the upper soil layers for oilseed crops. The estimated root distribution patterns from the present study could be incorporated into agroecosystem models for good representations of belowground processes and enhance the accuracy of carbon and water cycling estimation in agroecosystem.},

   abstract = {Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] of the Brassicaceae family is a potential alternative and oilseed biofuel crop for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based cropping systems of the Inland Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States. We investigated the effect of this relatively new rotational crop on soil microbial communities. An 8-year cropping systems experiment was initiated in 2007 at Lind, WA, to compare a 3-year rotation of winter wheat (WW)-camelina (C)-fallow (F) to the typical 2-year WW-F rotation. All phases of both rotations (total = 20 plots) were present every year to allow valid statistical analysis and data interpretations. Monoculture WW-F is the dominant system practiced by the vast majority of farmers on 1.56 million ha of cropland in the PNW drylands that receive <300 mm average annual precipitation. Microbial abundance and community composition were determined using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) from soil samples collected during 3 consecutive years beginning in 2010. The abundance of fungi, mycorrhizae, Gram positive and negative bacteria, and total microbial abundance all declined over the 3-year period in the WW-C-F rotation compared to the WW-F rotation. All microbial lipid biomarkers were significantly less in fallow compared to WW of the WW-C-F rotation. The 2-year WW-F rotation demonstrated few differences in microbial lipid abundance and community structure between the rotation phases. Microbial abundance declined and community structure shifted in the 3-year WW-C-F rotation likely due to the combination of a Brassica crop followed by a 13-month-long fallow. The results of this study suggest that camelina in combination with a fallow period may disrupt microbial communities that have become stable under historical WW-F monocropping. Such disturbances have the potential to affect soil processes that have been provided by wheat-adapted microbial communities. However, the disruption appears to be short-lived with the microbial abundance of WW in the WW-C-F rotation, returning to similar levels observed in the WW-F rotation.},

In order to quantify bacteria capable of N2O reduction, we developed a SYBR green quantitative real-time PCR assay targeting the nosZ gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the nitrous oxide reductase. Two independent sets of nosZ primers flanking the nosZ fragment previously used in diversity studies were designed and tested (K. Kloos, A. Mergel, C. Rösch, and H. Bothe, Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 28:991-998, 2001). The utility of these real-time PCR assays was demonstrated by quantifying the nosZ gene present in six different soils. Detection limits were between 101 and 10 2 target molecules per reaction for all assays. Sequence analysis of 128 cloned quantitative PCR products confirmed the specificity of the designed primers. The abundance of nosZ genes ranged from 105 to 10 7 target copies g-1 of dry soil, whereas genes for 16S rRNA were found at 108 to 109 target copies g-1 of dry soil. The abundance of narG and nirK genes was within the upper and lower limits of the 16S rRNA and nosZ gene copy numbers. The two sets of nosZ primers gave similar gene copy numbers for all tested soils. The maximum abundance of nosZ and nirK relative to 16S rRNA was 5 to 6%, confirming the low proportion of denitrifiers to total bacteria in soils. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology.

In particular there is evidence that yields of both oilseed rape and wheat can be influenced by the frequency in which they are grown in rotation with each other. In the current study we investigated the effect of preceding crops (either wheat or oilseed rape) on wheat and oilseed rape yield, with associated changes in the rhizosphere and bulk soil communities of fungi, bacteria and nematodes using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) of rRNA genes. Yield of wheat and oilseed rape were reduced by 11 and 10% respectively when grown two years consecutively. Rhizosphere populations were significantly different to bulk soil populations for all groups of organisms. Seasonal shifts in the communities were observed in the rhizosphere for all groups. Communities of fungi, bacteria and nematodes were all significantly influenced by the preceding crop in the wheat rhizosphere, while just the nematode population was affected by preceding crop in the oilseed rape rhizosphere. In particular when two consecutive crops of oilseed rape were grown, relative abundance of members of nematodes within the genus Eumonhystera increased markedly. The fungal foliar pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola, the teleomorph of Zymoseptoria tritici which causes septoria leaf blotch in wheat, was identified in the rhizosphere of wheat and was significantly more abundant in wheat grown after oilseed rape. We conclude that overall, preceding crop had less impact on community composition than season or crop type, but that specific changes in communities at particular plant growth stages may have substantive impacts on crop growth.},

   abstract = {Microorganisms are physiologically diverse, possessing disparate genomic features and mechanisms for adaptation (functional traits), which reflect on their associated life strategies and determine at least to some extent their prevalence and distribution in the environment. Unlike animals and plants, there is an unprecedented diversity and intractable metabolic versatility among bacteria, making classification or grouping these microorganisms based on their functional traits as has been done in animal and plant ecology challenging. Nevertheless, based on representative pure cultures, microbial traits distinguishing different life strategies had been proposed, and had been the focus of previous reviews. In the environment, however, the vast majority of naturally occurring microorganisms have yet to be isolated, restricting the association of life strategies to broad phylogenetic groups and/or physiological characteristics. Here, we reviewed the literature to determine how microbial life strategy concepts (i.e. copio- and oligotrophic strategists, and competitor-stress tolerator-ruderals framework) are applied in complex microbial communities. Because of the scarcity of direct empirical evidence elucidating the associated life strategies in complex communities, we rely heavily on observational studies determining the response of microorganisms to (a)biotic cues (e.g. resource availability) to infer microbial life strategies. Although our focus is on the life strategies of bacteria, parallels were drawn from the fungal community. Our literature search showed inconsistency in the community response of proposed copiotrophic- and oligotrophic-associated microorganisms (phyla level) to changing environmental conditions. This suggests that tracking microorganisms at finer phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution (e.g. family level or lower) may be more effective to capture changes in community response and/or that edaphic factors exert a stronger effect in community response. We discuss the limitations and provide recommendations for future research applying microbial life strategies in environmental studies.},

   abstract = {Adaptation of plants and microbes to drought stress affects various biochemical processes such as enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Nonetheless, it is largely unknown how this adaptation changes the spatial distribution of enzyme activities and catalytic properties of enzymes in the rhizosphere. Also, it is very important to know about the spatial pattern of enzyme activities in seminal and lateral roots regions to clarify how the interaction of drought and root types affects rhizosphere extent and enzyme activities. To fill these knowledge gaps, we grew wheat plants under drought (30% WHC, three weeks) and optimum (70% WHC) conditions and then coupled soil zymography with enzyme kinetics for studying β-glucosidase (GLU), acid phosphatase (ACP), and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). The results showed that drought considerably decreased the hotspot percentage of GLU and ACP activities by 63% and 67% in comparison with optimum moisture. In the regions of the seminal root, the rhizosphere extent of GLU and LAP, normalized rhizosphere extent, and total activity of GLU, ACP, and LAP were higher in optimum than in drought treatment. For the lateral root regions, no difference in the rhizosphere extent and total enzyme activities was found between drought and optimum moisture. Besides, we found higher normalized total enzyme activity in lateral roots regions than in seminal roots regions. Drought elevated the maximum enzymatic reaction velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of GLU whereas dropped the Vmax and Km (non-significant) of ACP and LAP in comparison with optimum moisture. The catalytic efficiency of GLU and ACP were 37% and 27% higher in optimum than in drought treatment. Our results revealed that effects of drought on rhizosphere extent and total enzyme activities in lateral roots regions were weaker than in seminal roots regions. Drought decreased microbial hotspots area, rhizosphere expansion of enzyme activities in seminal roots regions, and catalytic efficiency of enzyme systems. In conclusion, drought decreases root biomass and root exudations in the rhizosphere, leading to narrower microbial hotspots area and rhizosphere extent and thus to less enzyme catalytic efficiency.},

This study also elaborated the community composition, which has importance in economic (role of beneficial community leading to higher production) and environmental (role of microbial diversity/community in safeguarding the soil health, etc.) arenas. This could lead to a sustainable farming approach for food security and improved ecosystem health. Wheat being the important staple food crop plays a significant role in nutritional security. A wide variety of microbial communities beneficial to plants and contributing to plant health and production are found in the rhizosphere. The wheat microbiome encompasses an extensive variety of microbial species playing a key role in sustaining the physiology of the crop, nutrient uptake, and biotic/abiotic stress resilience. This report presents wheat microbiome analysis under six different farm practices, namely, organic (Org), timely sown (TS), wheat after pulse crop (WAPC), temperature-controlled phenotyping facility (TCPF), maize-wheat cropping system (MW), and residue burnt field (Bur), using 16S rRNA sequencing methodology. The soil samples collected from either side of the wheat row were mixed to get a final sample set for DNA extraction under each condition. After the data preprocessing, microbial community analysis was performed, followed by functional analysis and annotation. An abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria was observed, followed by Acidobacteria , Actinobacteria , and Gemmatimonadetes in the majority of the samples, while relative abundance was found to vary at the genus level. Analysis against the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database showed a high number of glycoside hydrolase genes in the TS, TCPF, and WAPC samples, while the Org, MW, and Bur samples predominantly had glycosyltransferase genes and carbohydrate esterase genes were in the lowest numbers. Also, the Org and TCPF samples showed lower diversity, while rare and abundant species ranged from 12 to 25% and 20 to 32% of the total bacterial species in all the sets, respectively. These variations indicate that the different cropping sequence had a significant impact on soil microbial diversity and community composition, which characterizes its economic and environmental value as a sustainable agricultural approach to maintaining food security and ecosystem health.

Also, the majority of the microbes are unculturable; hence, technology-based microcultivation will be a potential approach for harnessing other cultured microorganisms, leading to unique species for commercial production. The outcome of this research-accelerated work can provide an idea to the scientists/breeders/agronomists/pathologists under the mentioned field conditions regarding their influence over their crops. },

   abstract = {Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important crop worldwide, due to its multiple uses, such as a human food, animal feed and a bioenergetic crop. Traditionally, its cultivation is based on the use of chemical fertilizers, known to lead to several negative effects on human health and the environment. Plant growth-promoting bacteria may be used to reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, but efficient bacteria in controlled conditions frequently fail when applied to the fields. Bacterial endophytes, protected from the rhizospheric competitors and extreme environmental conditions, could overcome those problems and successfully promote the crops under field conditions. Here, we present a screening process among rapeseed bacterial endophytes to search for an efficient bacterial strain, which could be developed as an inoculant to biofertilize rapeseed crops. Based on in vitro, in planta, and in silico tests, we selected the strain Pseudomonas brassicacearum CDVBN10 as a promising candidate; this strain produces siderophores, solubilizes P, synthesizes cellulose and promotes plant height in 5 and 15 days-post-inoculation seedlings. The inoculation of strain CDVBN10 in a field trial with no addition of fertilizers showed significant improvements in pod numbers, pod dry weight and shoot dry weight. In addition, metagenome analysis of root endophytic bacterial communities of plants from this field trial indicated no alteration of the plant root bacterial microbiome; considering that the root microbiome plays an important role in plant fitness and development, we suggest this maintenance of the plant and its bacterial microbiome homeostasis as a positive result. Thus, Pseudomonas brassicacearum CDVBN10 seems to be a good biofertilizer to improve canola crops with no addition of chemical fertilizers; this the first study in which a plant growth-promoting (PGP) inoculant specifically designed for rapeseed crops significantly improves this crop’s yields in field conditions.},

It is well known that a multitude of microbes interact with eukaryotic organisms, including plants, and the sum of microbes and their functions associated with a given host is termed the microbiome. Plant-microbe interactions can be beneficial, neutral or harmful to the host plant. Over the last decade, with the development of next generation DNA sequencing technology, our understanding of the plant microbiome structure has dramatically increased. Considering that defining the wheat microbiome is key to leverage crop production in a sustainable way, here we describe how different factors drive microbiome assembly in wheat, including crop management, edaphic-environmental conditions and host selection. In addition, we highlight the benefits to take a multidisciplinary approach to define and explore the wheat core microbiome to generate solutions based on microbial (synthetic) communities or single inoculants. Advances in plant microbiome research will facilitate the development of microbial strategies to guarantee a sustainable intensification of crop production.},

   abstract = {In Europe, the framework for sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) production was subject to considerable changes and for the future it is expected that sugar beet cultivation might concentrate around the sugar factories for economic reasons. Based on data from a national sugar beet farmers’ survey and multi-year crop rotation trials, the effects of cropping interval (number of years in between two subsequent sugar beet crops) and of preceding crops on sugar yield were elucidated under current Central European management conditions. The dominating sugar beet cropping interval was ≥4 years in the farm survey with pronounced differences between regions. However, the cropping intervals 2, 3, and ≥4 years did not affect the sugar yield. Therefore, significant differences in sugar yield between regions were assumed to be caused by multiple interactions between year, site, and farmers’ skills. Throughout Germany, the dominating preceding crops in sugar beet cultivation were winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). In the field trials, the sugar yield was 5% higher after pea (Pisum sativum L.) compared to maize (Zea mays L.) as preceding crop, while differences between the preceding crops pea and winter wheat, and wheat and maize were not significant. Repeated measurements of canopy development and leaf color during the growing season revealed a higher N-availability after pea as preceding crop. However, decreased growth after maize was not completely compensated for by high N-fertilizer doses. Overall, the causes for the differences in sugar yield between the preceding crops remained open. The results do not support concerns about substantial yield losses in sugar beet production due to a reduction in the cropping interval from 3 to 2 years. Nevertheless, short rotations with maize and sugar beet might increase the risk of Rhizoctonia solani crown and root rot infestation. Leguminous crops such as pea offer the potential for higher sugar beet yield with lower N-fertilizer doses.},

   abstract = {Although it has been shown that the interaction of climate and time shape the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) storage and preservation in soil, the role of soil microbial communities in this dynamic remains unclear. Microbial communities are present throughout soil profiles and likely play critical roles in SOM and nutrient cycling, however the influence of other factors such as soil development (i.e., age) and the composition SOM on microbial community variation with depth has yet to be quantified. Improving our understanding of the relationship between soil development, soil depth, and microbial communities may provide insight to the critical role they play in cycling and preservation of SOM, as well as more mechanistic predictions of the response of soil communities to change, such as landscape-scale changes in available moisture or temperature regimes. Here we compare soils spanning a soil age by climate gradient (i.e., climo-chronosequence) to better understand the mechanisms which influence soil microbial community structure and the molecular composition of SOM. While we observed little depth-dependence in metrics of microbial community structure (i.e., composition, diversity, dissimilarity) across the range of soil development under a wetter climate, we found significant depth-dependent changes in community metrics under a drier climate, which became more pronounced as soils became older. This shift in bacterial and archaeal community structure and diversity is most apparent below a clay-rich argillic horizon formed in the older, drier soils. The molecular composition of SOM as measured by high resolution mass spectrometry (i.e., FTICR MS) also exhibited similar shifts in composition with soil depth and age. Our results highlight how soil moisture shapes the interaction of soil development, SOM, and microbial community composition. Differences in the moisture regime between our two study sites drive differences in biogeochemical depth gradients and subsequent variation in soil microbes and SOM. This suggests that knowledge of not just the pedogenic trajectory of soil development, but also the spatial position relative to distinct pedogenic features, are important for explaining variations in the depth-dependencies of microbial communities and associated SOM.},

After inoculation with the bacteria, levels of sugars and amino acids decreased in pine and beech rhizospheres, whereas organic acids increased , especially in the pine rhizosphere. In the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal beeches, sugar and amino acids increased, and organic acids differed from those released from non-mycorrhizal beeches.

We used 557 pairs of published 16S rDNA amplicon sequences from the bulk soils and rhizosphere in different ecosystems around the world to generalize bacterial characteristics with respect to community diversity, composition, and functions. The rhizosphere selects microorganisms from bulk soil to function as a seed bank, reducing microbial diversity. The rhizosphere is enriched in Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and other copiotrophs. Highly modular but unstable bacterial networks in the rhizosphere (common for r-strategists) reflect the interactions and adaptations of microorganisms to dynamic conditions. Dormancy strategies in the rhizosphere are dominated by toxin–antitoxin systems, while sporulation is common in bulk soils. Functional predictions showed that genes involved in organic compound conversion, nitrogen fixation, and denitrification were strongly enriched in the rhizosphere (11–182%), while genes involved in nitrification were strongly depleted.},

However, the mechanism by which biotic and abiotic factors are affected by different cropping systems remain unclear. In this study, we comparatively investigated the bacterial and fungal abundance, diversity and community compositions in the bulk and rhizospheric soils of soybean continuously cropped in the short-term for 3 and 5 years (CC3 and CC5) and in the long-term for 13 years (CC13), as well as cropping rotation with maize in alternately for 5 years (CR5) using qPCR and high-throughput sequencing methods. The results showed that soil pH, and available nutrients such as N, P and K were significantly higher in the bulk soils of CC13 and CR in contrast to CC3 and CC5. The fungi/bacteria ratio was significantly higher in the rhizospheric soils of CC3 and CC5 than that in CR5 and CC13, indicating that short-term continuously cropped soybean decreases bacterial abundance but increases fungal abundance. The bacterial and fungal community structures were significantly altered by different cropping systems, and the soil pH and C/N were the primary soil factors in shifting the bacterial and fungal community structures in the bulk soils, respectively. Bacterial and fungal co-occurrence patterns were remarkably affected by cropping systems, which showed that CC13 and CR5 harbor co-occurrence networks that are more complex than CC3 and CC5. Moreover, CC13 and CR5 increased the relative abundances of potentially beneficial bacteria Bradyrhizobium sp. and Gemmatimonas sp. and fungi Mortierella sp. and Paecilomyces sp. but decreased the relative abundances of the pathogenic fungi Fusarium sp. in contrast to CC3 and CC5, which indicated that long-term continuous cropping of soybean might have generated a possibility of the development of disease-suppressive soils.},

However, the understanding of the abundance and distribution of these functional microorganisms as well as their driving factors were limited mainly to topsoil. In this study, the abundances of nitrogen functional genes (NFGs) involved in nitrogen fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA), and denitrification (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) were investigated in both topsoil (0–10 cm, soil layer with concentrated root) and subsoil (30–40 cm, soil layer with spare root) of three grassland habitats in northern China. The abundance of NFGs decreased with soil depth except for the archaeal amoA gene and the distribution of nifH, archaeal amoA, nirK, and nirS gene was significantly impacted by grassland habitats. Moreover, the distribution of NFGs was more responsive to the vertical difference than horizontal spatial heterogeneity. Redundancy analysis revealed that the distribution pattern of overall NFGs was regulated by grassland habitats, and these regulations were more obvious in the subsoil than in the topsoil. Variance partitioning analysis further indicated that soil resource supply (e.g., organic matter) may control the vertical distribution of NFGs. Taken together, the findings in this study could fundamentally improve our understanding of the distribution of N cycling-associated microorganisms across a vertical scale, which would be useful for predicting the soil N availability and guiding the soil N management in grassland ecosystems.},

This study aimed to elucidate whether ARD is systemic, i.e. whether the contact of parts of the root system with ARD soil causes the whole plant to show poor shoot and root growth. A split-root experiment was conducted with seedlings of 'M26', offering the same plant for its root system the choice between the substrates ARD soil (+ARD), γ-sterilized ARD soil (-ARD) or soil from a grass parcel (Control) with the following combinations: +ARD/+ARD,-ARD/-ARD; +ARD/-ARD; +ARD/Control. Root growth was analysed throughout the 34-day growing period. Samples from bulk, rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil were collected separately for each compartment, and analysed by fingerprints of 16S rRNA gene or ITS fragments amplified from total community (TC) DNA. The response of the plant to +ARD was not systemic as root growth in-ARD compartment was always superior to root growth in +ARD soil. Crosswise 15N-labelling of the N-fertilizer applied to the split-root compartments showed that nitrate-N uptake efficiency was higher for roots in-ARD soil compared to those in +ARD. Bacterial and fungal community composition in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere of the same plants differed significantly between the compartments containing +ARD/-ARD or +ARD/Control. The strongest differences between the bacterial fingerprints were observed in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere. Bacterial genera with increased abundance in response to ARD were mainly Streptomyces but also Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Rhizobium, Lysobacter and Variovorax. The strongest differences between the fungal fingerprints were observed in bulk soil. Our data showed that the response of the apple plant to ARD soil is local and not systemic.},

Glyphosate reduced the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in W–W rotation but increased it in P–W rotation, and it reduced the relative abundance of Opitutus spp. The W–W rotation had greater relative abundances of the classes Bacilli (Firmicutes) and Gammaproteobacteria, and genera Bacillus and Opitutus (Verrucomicrobia), than the P–W rotation. Compared with MT, NT increased the relative abundance of the phylum candidate division WPS-1, but it reduced that of Phenylobacterium spp. in W–W rotation.

However, the soil microbiome has not been characterized in most long-term trials. We used a field trial established in 1911 to identify the core soil bacteria and their functioning in century-old wheat rotations, and how soil moisture deficit affected them. We collected soil samples from three wheat rotations: continuous wheat (W), fallow-wheat (FW) and fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW), all with or without N + P fertilizer, and incubated them with or without soil moisture deficit. The crop rotation effects on microbial biomass C (MBC) were in the order: W > FWW = FW. Fertilizer increased soil MBC by 21%. The activities of β-glucosidase (C cycling), N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (C and N cycling), and acid phosphomonoesterase (P cycling) followed similar trends, as did soil N supply measured in the field. The α-diversity of the soil bacteria was lower in continuous wheat than in the other rotations, and decreased with fertilizer application. Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were more abundant in continuous wheat than other rotations, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased with fertilizer application. By contrast, Acidobacteria were less abundant in continuous wheat than in other rotations. Soil moisture deficit during incubation had no effects on the soil microbiome. The core bacterial genera present in 90% of the soil samples were Bradyrhizobium, Rubrobacter, Friedmanniela and Marmoricola. β-diversity analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure in continuous wheat with fertilizer application was different from the structures in the other treatments. These and previously-published soil organic C, N and wheat yield results suggest that microbe-mediated nutrient cycling enabled sustainable continuous wheat cropping when fertilizer was applied.},

   abstract = {The drivers underlying the development of deep root systems, whether genetic or environmental, are poorly understood but evidence has accumulated that deep rooting could be a more widespread and important trait among plants than commonly anticipated from their share of root biomass. Even though a distinct classification of "deep roots" is missing to date, deep roots provide important functions for individual plants such as nutrient and water uptake but can also shape plant communities by hydraulic lift (HL). Subterranean fauna and microbial communities are highly influenced by resources provided in the deep rhizosphere and deep roots can influence soil pedogenesis and carbon storage.Despite recent technological advances, the study of deep roots and their rhizosphere remains inherently time-consuming, technically demanding and costly, which explains why deep roots have yet to be given the attention they deserve. While state-of-the-art technologies are promising for laboratory studies involving relatively small soil volumes, they remain of limited use for the in situ observation of deep roots. Thus, basic techniques such as destructive sampling or observations at transparent interfaces with the soil (e.g., root windows) which have been known and used for decades to observe roots near the soil surface, must be adapted to the specific requirements of deep root observation. In this review, we successively address major physical, biogeochemical and ecological functions of deep roots to emphasize the significance of deep roots and to illustrate the yet limited knowledge. In the second part we describe the main methodological options to observe and measure deep roots, providing researchers interested in the field of deep root/rhizosphere studies with a comprehensive overview. Addressed methodologies are: excavations, trenches and soil coring approaches, minirhizotrons (MR), access shafts, caves and mines, and indirect approaches such as tracer-based techniques. © 2013 Maeght, Rewald and Pierret.},

   abstract = {Theory and experiments suggest that rhizodeposition can accelerate N-cycling by stimulating microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). However, there are remarkably few experimental demonstrations on the degree to which variations in root exudation alter rhizosphere N dynamics in the field. We conducted a series of in situ substrate addition experiments and a modeling exercise to investigate how exudate mimics and enzyme solutions (at varying concentrations) influence rhizosphere SOM and N dynamics in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation (Duke Forest). Exudates were added semi-continuously to unfertilized and fertilized soils in summer and fall; enzymes were added during the following summer. Exudate additions enhanced the microbial biomass specific activities of enzymes that degrade fast-cycling N pools (i.e., amino acids and amino sugars), and increased microbial allocation to N-degrading compounds. More, such effects occurred at low exudate concentrations in unfertilized soil and at higher concentrations in fertilized soil. Direct additions of a subset of enzymes (amino sugar- and cellulose-degrading) to soils increased net N mineralization rates, but additions of enzymes that cleave slow-cycling SOM did not. We conclude that exudates can stimulate microbes to decompose labile SOM and release N without concomitant changes in microbial biomass, yet the investment of plants to trigger this effect may be greater in N-rich soils.},

   abstract = {Two factors that are well-known to influence soil microbiomes are the depth of the soil as well as the level of moisture. Previous works have demonstrated that climate change will increase the incidence of drought in soils, but it is unknown how fluctuations in moisture availability affect soil microbiome composition and functioning down the depth profile. Here, we investigated soil and wheatgrass rhizosphere microbiomes in a single common field setting under four different levels of irrigation (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%) and three depths (0-5 cm, 5-15 cm, and 15-25 cm from the surface). We demonstrated that there is a significant interactive effect between depth and irrigation, where changes in soil moisture more strongly affect soil microbiomes at the surface layer than at deeper layers. This was true for not only microbiome community composition and diversity metrics, but also for functional profiles (transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets). Meanwhile, in rhizosphere communities the influence of irrigation was similar across the different depths. However, for the ‘Alkar’ wheatgrass cultivar, the rhizosphere microbial communities responded more strongly to changes in irrigation level than did the communities for the ‘Jose’ cultivar rhizosphere. The lessened response of deeper soil microbiomes to changes in irrigation may be due to higher incidence of slow-growing, stress-resistant microbes. These results demonstrate that the soil microbiome response to moisture content is depth-dependent. As such, it will be optimal for soil microbiome studies to incorporate deeper as well as surface soils, to get a more accurate picture of the soil microbiome response to stress.},

   abstract = {Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1–3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn–soybean–wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. In addition, disease suppressive potential was significantly diminished in the (non-crop) fallow treatment compared to the most diverse crop rotation treatments. The composition of the microbial community could be more important than diversity to disease suppressive function in our study. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.},

Bacterial DNA was directly extracted from the soils, and a region of the nifH gene was amplified by PCR and analyzed by restriction. Soils were selected on the basis of differences in soil management, plant cover, and major physicochemical properties. Microenvironments differed on the basis of the sizes of the constituent particles and the organic carbon and clay contents. Restriction profiles were subjected to principal-component analysis. We showed that the composition of the diazotrophic communities varied both on a large scale (among soils) and on a microscale (among microenvironments in LCSA-c soil). Soil management seemed to be the major parameter influencing differences in the nifH gene pool structure among soils by controlling inorganic nitrogen content and its variation. However, physicochemical parameters (texture and total C and N contents) were found to correlate with differences among nifH gene pools on a microscale. We hypothesize that the observed nifH genetic structures resulted from the adaptation to fluctuating conditions (cultivated soil, forest soil, coarse fractions) or constant conditions (permanent pasture soil, fine fractions). We attempted to identify a specific band within the profile of the clay fraction by cloning and sequencing it and comparing it with the gene databases. Unexpectedly, the nifH sequences of the dominant bacteria were most similar to sequences of unidentified marine eubacteria.},

   abstract = {Background: Conventional methods of agricultural pest control and crop fertilisation are unsustainable. To meet growing demand, we must find ecologically responsible means to control disease and promote crop yields. The root-associated microbiome can aid plants with disease suppression, abiotic stress relief, and nutrient bioavailability. The aim of the present work was to profile the community of bacteria, fungi, and archaea associated with the wheat rhizosphere and root endosphere in different conditions. We also aimed to use 13CO2 stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify microbes within the root compartments that were capable of utilising host-derived carbon. Results: Metabarcoding revealed that community composition shifted significantly for bacteria, fungi, and archaea across compartments. This shift was most pronounced for bacteria and fungi, while we observed weaker selection on the ammonia oxidising archaea-dominated archaeal community. Across multiple soil types we found that soil inoculum was a significant driver of endosphere community composition, however, several bacterial families were identified as core enriched taxa in all soil conditions. The most abundant of these were Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae. Moreover, as the plants senesce, both families were reduced in abundance, indicating that input from the living plant was required to maintain their abundance in the endosphere. Stable isotope probing showed that bacterial taxa within the Burkholderiaceae family, among other core enriched taxa such as Pseudomonadaceae, were able to use root exudates, but Streptomycetaceae were not. Conclusions: The consistent enrichment of Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae within the endosphere, and their reduced abundance after developmental senescence, indicated a significant role for these families within the wheat root microbiome. While Streptomycetaceae did not utilise root exudates in the rhizosphere, we provide evidence that Pseudomonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae family taxa are recruited to the wheat root community via root exudates. This deeper understanding crop microbiome formation will enable researchers to characterise these interactions further, and possibly contribute to ecologically responsible methods for yield improvement and biocontrol in the future.},

A main premise for evaluating microbial communities associated with root-soil compartments is their successful separation into the rhizosphere (soil-root interface), the rhizoplane (root surface), and the endosphere (inside roots). We evaluated different approaches (washing, sonication, and bleaching) regarding their efficiency to separate microbial cells associated with different root compartments of soil-grown rice using fluorescence microscopy and community fingerprinting of 16S rRNA genes. Vigorous washing detached 45% of the rhizoplane population compared to untreated roots. Additional sonication reduced rhizoplane-attached microorganisms by up to 78% but caused various degrees of root tissue destruction at all sonication intensities tested. Treatment with sodium hypochlorite almost completely (98%) removed rhizoplane-associated microbial cells. Community fingerprinting revealed that microbial communities obtained from untreated, washed, and sonicated roots were not statistically distinguishable. Hypochlorite-treated roots harbored communities significantly different from all other samples, likely representing true endospheric populations. Applying these procedures to other root samples (bean and clover) revealed that treatment efficiencies were strongly affected by root morphological parameters such as root hair density and rigidity of epidermis. Our findings suggest that a careful evaluation of separation strategies prior to molecular community analysis is indispensable, especially when endophytes are the subject of interest.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Grassland ecosystems are a major store of terrestrial carbon (C), yet little is known about their capacity to cycle and store C in deeper soil horizons. Further, it is unclear how plant community composition within agricultural grasslands mediates this capacity and influences microbial community composition. We investigated whether the aboveground community composition in intensively managed agricultural grasslands influenced belowground microbial community composition, abundance, respiration and enzyme activities with depth. Materials and Methods: Soil was sampled in four soil layers: A (0–15 cm), B (15–30 cm), C (30–60 cm) and D (60–90 cm) in monocultures of six grassland species and a mixture of all six. Functional capacity was measured through enzymatic and substrate-induced respiration assays, and microbial abundance and diversity were assessed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing (16S, Internal transcribed spacer), respectively. Results: Microbial abundance and C cycling enzyme activity decreased and community composition changed, along the soil depth gradient, regardless of the plant community. Microbial abundance was not significantly influenced by plant community type across the entire soil depth profile. However, prokaryotic community composition was significantly influenced by plant community in the top 15 cm of soil, and fungal community composition was significantly influenced between 15 and 30 cm in depth. Plant community types mediated the rate at which C cycling enzyme activity decreased along the soil depth gradient, and selected C cycling enzymes were significantly more active at 15–60 cm depth when Cichorium intybus (a deep rooting species) was present. Conclusion: This study provides an improved understanding of how agricultural grassland communities affect the soil microbiome with depth; this has potential implications for the management of these systems for enhanced soil health. Our work indicates the potential for multispecies mixtures with deep rooting species to be a practical strategy to increase C cycling capacity in deeper soil layers within grasslands, which may have implications for policy goals related to C storage.},

Fungal communities were highly stratified with soil depth, where deeper depths harbored distinct fungal taxa and more variable, less diverse fungal communities.

Co-occurrence networks of fungal taxa became smaller and denser as soil depth increased.

However, most studies exploring the spatial distribution of soil bacterial communities have focused on the top 10–20 cm of soil, leaving our knowledge of the composition, diversity, and forces structuring subsoil communities relatively unexplored. Moreover, in agricultural soil managed without tillage (no-till), fertilizers often generate an acidified soil layer in the seed zone, rendering no-till soils a unique system in which to study the relative impacts of pH and soil depth on microbial communities. We characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in a no-till wheat-based cropping system from eastern Washington, across soil depths (0 cm, 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, and 100 cm). Soil depth was a strong driver of bacterial community composition and diversity. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the soil surface, Acidobacteria peaked in relative abundance at 10 cm, and Actinobacteria and unidentified taxa were greatest in relative abundance below 25 cm. However, acidified soil disrupted relationships between soil depth and bacterial communities, resulting in a low diversity and distinct composition of bacterial communities at the 10 cm depth. Co-occurrence networks of bacterial taxa revealed groups of co-occurring taxa that responded primarily to soil pH or depth.

   abstract = {The Inland Pacific Northwest is one of the most productive dryland wheat production areas in the United States. We explored the bacterial and fungal communities associated with wheat in a controlled greenhouse experiment using soils from multiple locations to identify core taxa consistently associated with wheat roots and how land use history influences wheat-associated communities. Further, we examined microbial co-occurrence networks from wheat rhizospheres to identify candidate hub taxa. Location of origin and land use history (long-term no-till versus noncropped Conservation Reserve Program [CRP]) of soils were the strongest drivers of bacterial and fungal communities. Wheat rhizospheres were especially enriched in many bacterial families, while only a few fungal taxa were enriched in the rhizo-sphere. There was a core set of bacteria and fungi that was found in 95% of rhizo-sphere or bulk soil samples, including members of Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomon-adaceae, Massilia, Variovorax, Oxalobacteraceae, and Caulobacteraceae. Core fungal taxa in the rhizosphere included Nectriaceae, Ulocladium, Alternaria, Mortierella, and Microdochium. Overall, there were fewer core fungal taxa, and the rhizosphere effect was not as pronounced as with bacteria. Cross-domain co-occurrence networks were used to identify hub taxa in the wheat rhizosphere, which included bacterial and fungal taxa (e.g., Sphingomonas, Massilia, Knufia, and Microdochium). Our results suggest that there is a relatively small group of core rhizosphere bacteria that were highly abundant on wheat roots regardless of soil origin and land use history. These core communities may play important roles in nutrient uptake, suppressing fungal pathogens, and other plant health functions. IMPORTANCE Plant-associated microbiomes are critical for plant health and other important agroecosystem processes. We assessed the bacterial and fungal micro-biomes of wheat grown in soils from across a dryland wheat cropping systems in eastern Washington to identify the core microbiome on wheat roots that is consistent across soils from different locations and land use histories. Moreover, cross-domain co-occurrence network analysis identified core and hub taxa that may play important roles in microbial community assembly. Candidate core and hub taxa provide a starting point for targeting microbiome components likely to be critical to plant health and for constructing synthetic microbial communities for further experimentation. This work is one of the first examples of identifying a core microbiome on a major field crop grown across hundreds of square kilometers over a wide range of biogeographical zones.},

   abstract = {Local diversity (within-sample or alpha diversity) is often implicated as a cause of success or failure of a microbial community. However, the relationships between diversity and emergent properties of a community, such as its stability, productivity or invasibility, are much more nuanced. I argue that diversity without context provides limited insights into the mechanisms underpinning community patterns. I provide examples from traditional and microbial ecology to discuss common complications and assumptions about within-sample diversity that may prevent us from digging deeper into the more specific mechanisms underpinning community outcomes. I suggest that measurement of diversity should serve as a starting point for further inquiry of ecological mechanisms rather than an 'answer' to community outcomes.},

   abstract = {Different preceding crops interact with almost all husbandry and have a major effect on crop yields. In order to quantify the yield response of winter wheat, a field trial with different preceding crop combinations (oilseed rape (OSR)-OSR-OSR-wheat-wheat-wheat), two sowing dates (mid/end of September, mid/end of October) and 16 mineral nitrogen (N) treatments (80-320 kg N ha -1) during 1993/1994-1998/1999, was carried out at Hohenschulen Experimental Station near Kiel in NW Germany. Single plant biomass, tiller numbers m-2, biomass m-2, grain yield and yield components at harvest were investigated. During the growing season, the incidence of root rot (Gaeumannomyces graminis) was observed. Additionally, a bioassay with Lemna minor was used to identify the presence of allelochemicals in the soil after different preceding crops. Averaged over all years and all other treatments, wheat following OSR achieved nearly 9.5 t ha-1, whereas the second wheat crop following wheat yielded about 0.9 t ha-1 and the third wheat crop following 2 years of wheat about 1.9 t ha-1 less compared with wheat after OSR. A delay of the sowing date only marginally decreased grain yield by 0.2 t ha-1. Nitrogen fertilization increased grain yield after all preceding crop combinations, but at different levels. Wheat grown after OSR reached its maximum yield of 9.7 t ha-1 with 210 kg N ha-1. The third wheat crop required a N amount of 270 kg N ha -1 to achieve its yield maximum of 8.0 t ha-1. Yield losses were mainly caused by a lower ear density and a reduced thousand grain weight. About 4 weeks after plant establishment, single wheat plants following OSR accumulated more biomass compared to plants grown after wheat. Plants from the third wheat crop were smallest. This range of the preceding crop combinations was similar at all sampling dates throughout the growing season. Root rot occurred only at a low level and was excluded to cause the yield losses. The Lemna bioassay suggested the presence of allelochemicals, which might have been one reason for the poor single plant development in autumn. An increased N fertilization compensated for the lower number of ears m -2 and partly reduced the yield losses due to the unfavorable preceding crop combination. However, it was not possible to completely compensate for the detrimental influences of an unfavorable preceding crop on the grain yield of the subsequent wheat crop. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The soil-borne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) causing take-all in wheat, barley and rye is regarded as the most important disease on wheat in short rotations with a high proportion of cereals. In 1996/97-1998/99, winter wheat was grown in a field trial with two preceding crops (oilseed rape (OSR) vs. winter wheat), two sowing dates (end of September vs. end of October), eight mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments (0-200 kg N ha-1) and fluquinconazole seed treatment (no vs. yes), which was carried out at the Hohenschulen Experimental Station near Kiel in NW Ger-many. Tiller numbers m-2 , biomass m-2 , grain yield, and yield components at harvest of wheat (cv. Toronto) were investigated. During the growing season, the incidence of take-all caused by Ggt was rated on a scale of 1-9. Averaged over all years and all other treatments, wheat following OSR achieved 8 t ha-1 , whereas wheat following wheat yielded 1 t ha-1 (13%) less compared with wheat after OSR, due to a reduction of all yield components. A delay of the sowing date only marginally decreased grain yield by 0.2 t ha-1. N fertilization increased grain yield after all preceding crop combinations, but at different levels. Fluquinconazole seed treatment augmented yield by 0.05 t ha-1 in the first wheat and by 0.11 t ha-1 in the second wheat. Take-all occurred at a very low level in all three years (2.2-3.2). Wheat as preceding crop significantly increased Ggt severity at maturity from 2.3 (after OSR) up to 3.2, whereas fluquinconazole seed treatment reduced take-all by 0.2 units. Disease progress curves based on the sum of degree-days since sowing (base: 0°C) revealed a very low Ggt infestation at the end of autumn growth and at the beginning of spring growth, but a progressive increase developed throughout the further growing season. Based on the data of wheat following wheat and fertilized with 0 or 40 kg N ha-1 , a relationship between disease rating and grain yield was established using a linear-plateau function, which indicates yield penalties if Ggt rating exceeds 2.5 units at maturity. Since the preceding crop not only changes the inoculum of take-all but other parameters like soil structure, weed infestation, nutrient status, amount and composition of residues etc., the possibility of chemical control of Ggt allows to study the fungus without altering the plant environment. Der bodenbürtige Pilz Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), der Schwarzbeinigkeit an Weizen, Gerste und Roggen verursacht, wird als die wichtigste Krankheit von Weizen in engen Fruchtfolgen mit einem hohen Getreideanteil ange-sehen. In den Vegetationsperioden 1996/97-1998/99 wurde auf dem Versuchsgut Hohenschulen bei Kiel (Schleswig-Holstein) ein Feldversuch mit Winterweizen (cv. Toronto) durchgeführt, in dem zwei Vorfrüchte (Winterraps vs. Winter-weizen), zwei Aussaattermine (Ende September vs. Ende Oktober), acht Stickstoffstufen (0-200 kg N ha-1) und der Einsatz von Fluquinconazol als Saatgutbehandlungsmittel getestet wurden. Während der Vegetationsperiode wurden die Anzahl der Triebe je m 2 und die Trockenmassebildung untersucht. Zur Ernte wurden der Kornertrag und die Ertrags-struktur erfasst. Zu allen Untersuchungsterminen erfolgte eine Bonitur des Befalls mit Schwarzbeinigkeit auf einer Skala von 1-9. Im Mittel der Jahre und der übrigen Versuchsfaktoren rea-lisierte Weizen nach Raps 8 t ha-1 , während vom Weizen nach Weizen einen um 1 t ha-1 (13%) geringeren Ertrag geerntet wurden. Die Ertragseinbußen beruhten auf einer Reduktion aller drei Ertragskomponenten (Ährenzahl je m 2 , Kornzahl je Ähre, Tausendkornmasse). Eine verspätete Aussaat reduzierte den Ertrag lediglich um 0.2 t ha-1. Die N-Düngung erhöhte den Kornertrag nach beiden Vorfrüchten, allerdings auf unter-schiedlichem Niveau. Eine Saatgutbehandlung mit Fluquinco-nazol steigerte den Ertrag des Weizens nach Raps um 0.05 t ha-1 und den des Weizens nach Weizen um 0.11 t ha-1. In allen drei Jahren trat Schwarzbeinigkeit nur in geringem Maße (2.2-3.2 zur Ernte) auf. Im Vergleich zu Raps (2.3) steigerte die Vorfrucht Weizen den Ggt-Befall auf 3.2. Der Einsatz von Fluquinconazol senkte den Befall um 0.2 Bonitur-stufen. Der Befallsverlauf in Abhängigkeit der Temperatur-summe seit Aussaat (Basis: 0°C) zeigte einen geringen Befall vor und nach Winter, der aber im weiteren Verlauf progressiv zunahm. Die Befalls-Verlust-Relation wurde für Weizen nach Weizen in den ungedüngten bzw. mit 40 kg N ha-1 gedüngten Varianten mittels einer Linear-Plateau-Funktion geschätzt. Danach ist mit Ertragseinbußen zu rechnen, wenn der Ggt-Befall zur Ernte den Wert von 2.5 überschreitet. Da die Vorfrucht nicht nur das Erregerinokulum, sondern auch noch andere Parameter wie Bodenstruktur, Verunkrautung, Nährstoffhaus-halt, Menge und Zusammensetzung der Ernterückstände etc. beeinflusst, eröffnet die chemische Kontrolle von Ggt mittels Saatgutbehandlung die Möglichkeit, den Erreger zu unter-suchen, ohne die Umwelt der Pflanze zu verändern.},

   abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an in vitro procedure for primer-directed enzymatic amplification of specific template nucleic acid sequences. In order to determine whether a given actinomycete isolated from an actinorhiza (nodule) belongs to the genus Frankia or is a contaminant, we have developed a test based on the PCR. Primers complementary to sequences of two DNA regions corresponding to the nif genes (nipI and nifD) and the rRNA genes (16S and 23S) were specifically chosen to differentially amplify DNAs from Frankia strains but not those from other microorganisms. A series of positive and negative controls were set up by using universal or selective primers resulting in a discriminant amplification, which could be detected after agarose gel electrophoresis. In the nif region, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify a target common to all the nitrogen-fixing microorganisms tested, while another set of primers amplified a target with a high specificity for Frankia strains. In the rRNA gene region, universal and specific primers were characterized and tested with DNAs from a wide range of microorganisms. The efficiency of this rapid and sensitive PCR assay was tested with an isolate obtained from Alnus nepaknsis nodules, confirming results obtained by nodulation tests. Investigations of symbiotic nitrogen fixation have so far concerned interactions between Rhizobium spp. and annual leguminous plants. Limited information has been generated on another important nitrogen-fixing symbiosis involving woody dicotyledonous plants and Frankia strains, filamen-tous prokaryotes belonging to the order Actinomycetales (for recent reviews, see Normand and Lalonde [31], Simonet et al. [43], and Mullin and An [25]). One of the reasons for this can be the problems associated with the isolation and identification of Frankia strains. Although an increasing number of Frankia strains have been isolated since 1978, problems of obtaining isolates in pure cultures and the definition of their growth requirements have restricted studies pertaining to the genetics, ecology, and physiology of this symbiosis. Despite considerable improvements in various culture media, Frankia strains continue to be slowly growing actinomycetes requiring months to obtain a biomass suitable for experimentation. Moreover, in spite of numerous attempts , no isolate from Alnus sp. nodules or from the host species belonging to the families Datiscaceae, Coriariaceae, Rhamnaceae, and most Rosaceae has yet been described. The first classification within the genus Frankia was based on the ability to nodulate various host plants with crushed nodules as inocula. However, numerous problems were encountered (3), and improvement became possible only with the development of new criteria of classification, making use of biochemical and molecular biology techniques. For instance, isolates belonging to the genus Frankia can be characterized by criteria such as morphology (presence of hyphae, vesicles, and sporangia) (21), physiology (presence of a typical sugar) (24), cell wall components of type III (23), and genotype (G+C content in the range of 68 to 72%) (12). A typical Frankia strain also possesses the ability to nodu-* Corresponding author. t Present address: late and fix nitrogen, but the determination of such criteria is time-consuming and does not take into account strains deleted of their nod or nifgenes. More recently, comparison of 16S rRNA sequences has allowed a redefinition of the family Frankiaceae by including in it the genera Blastococ-cus and Geodermatophilus (15). Moreover, genetic diversity within the genus Frankia was investigated by using DNA-DNA hybridization of the whole genome and DNA base composition which resulted in the delineation of nine ge-nomic species among the strains tested (12). Finally, the development of rapid protocols to amplify and sequence segments of 16S rDNA confirmed these results and showed particular potential to classify nonisolatable strains by amplifying and sequencing Frankia DNA extracted from a nodule (27). Regarding other criteria, several authors have demonstrated that morphological characteristics are dependent on culture conditions and most of the physiological or genetic properties described for Frankia strains are also common to other actinomycetes. It appears that actinorhiza researchers need a fast and easy identification test based on more than one parameter which could be used for the first cells growing outside the crushed nodule in the in vitro isolation assay. Nucleic acid hybridization probes show an increasing potential for the rapid identification of microorganisms, and they are particularly useful for screening large numbers of specimens. Detection of organism-specific DNA sequences by nucleic acid hybridization offers the possibility of working on crude material, thus eliminating the need to obtain the microorganism in pure culture. However, nucleic acid hy-bridization suffers from disadvantages, including the many precautions necessary when using radioactive labels (though nonradioactive labels have been developed and used successfully) and a lack of sensitivity, requiring large numbers of cells for detection (42). Improvement in the sensitivity of the hybridization assay can be achieved by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. This process is capable of 3278},

We characterized the prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and protists) communities in soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France, Italy, Senegal) and determined if a rhizosphere core microbiome existed across these different countries. The wheat genotype had a limited effect on the rhizosphere microbiome (2% of variance) as the majority of the microbial taxa were consistently associated to multiple wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. Large differences in taxa richness and in community structure were observed between the eight soils studied (57% variance) and the two agricultural practices (10% variance). Despite these differences between soils, we observed that 177 taxa (2 archaea, 103 bacteria, 41 fungi and 31 protists) were consistently detected in the rhizosphere, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these core taxa were highly abundant and collectively represented 50% of the reads in our data set. Based on these results, we identify a list of key taxa as future targets of culturomics, metagenomics and wheat synthetic microbiomes. Additionally, we show that protists are an integral part of the wheat holobiont that is currently overlooked.},

However, it is unclear to what extent cereal yields change with crop rotation diversity and external nitrogen fertilization level over time, and which functional groups of crops provide the most yield benefit. Here, using grain yield data of small grain cereals and maize from 32 long-term (10–63 years) experiments across Europe and North America, we show that crop rotational diversity, measured as crop species diversity and functional richness, enhanced grain yields. This yield benefit increased over time. Only the yields of winter-sown small grain cereals showed a decline at the highest level of species diversity. Diversification was beneficial to all cereals with a low external nitrogen input, particularly maize, enabling a lower dependence on nitrogen fertilisers and ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen pollution. The results suggest that increasing crop functional richness rather than species diversity can be a strategy for supporting grain yields across many environments.},

Soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations decreased exponentially with soil depth and revealed a buried carbon-rich horizon between 0.8 and 1.3 m across all soil cores. This buried horizon was phylogenetically similar to its surrounding subsoils supporting the idea that the type of carbon, not necessarily the amount of carbon was driving the apparent similarities. In contrast to other studies, Nitrospirae was one of our major phyla with relatively high abundances throughout the soil profile except for the surface soil. Although depth is the major driver shaping soil bacterial community structure, positive correlations with SOC and N concentrations, however, were revealed with the bacterial abundance of Acidobacteria, one of the major, and Gemmatimonadetes, one of the minor phyla in our study. Our study showed that bacterial diversity in soils below 2.0 m can be still as high if not higher than in the above laying subsurface soil suggesting that various bacteria throughout the soil profile influence major biogeochemical processes in floodplain soils.},

These reactors included seven (six mesophilic and one thermophilic) digesting sewage sludge (SS) and 14 (ten mesophilic and four thermophilic) codigesting (CD) various combinations of wastes from slaughterhouses, restaurants, households, etc. The pyrosequencing generated more than 160 000 sequences representing 11 phyla, 23 classes, and 95 genera of Bacteria and Archaea. The bacterial community was always both more abundant and more diverse than the archaeal community. At the phylum level, the foremost populations in the SS reactors included Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Spirochetes, and Euryarchaeota, while Firmicutes was the most prevalent in the CD reactors. The main bacterial class in all reactors was Clostridia. Acetoclastic methanogens were detected in the SS, but not in the CD reactors. Their absence suggests that methane formation from acetate takes place mainly via syntrophic acetate oxidation in the CD reactors. A principal component analysis of the communities at genus level revealed three clusters: SS reactors, mesophilic CD reactors (including one thermophilic CD and one SS), and thermophilic CD reactors. Thus, the microbial composition was mainly governed by the substrate differences and the process temperature. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

Here, we examine the composition of rhizosphere bacterial communities of diverse Brassica napus genotypes to identify: (1) taxa that preferentially associate with genotypes, (2) core bacterial microbiota associated with B. napus, (3) heritable alpha diversity measures at flowering and whole growing season, and (4) correlation between microbial and plant genetic distance among canola genotypes at different growth stages. Our aim is to identify and describe signature microbiota with potential positive benefits that could be integrated in B. napus breeding and management strategies. Rhizosphere soils of 16 diverse genotypes sampled weekly over a 10-week period at single location as well as at three time points at two additional locations were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The B. napus rhizosphere microbiome was characterized by diverse bacterial communities with 32 named bacterial phyla. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Overall microbial and plant genetic distances were highly correlated (R = 0.65). Alpha diversity heritability estimates were between 0.16 and 0.41 when evaluated across growth stage and between 0.24 and 0.59 at flowering. Compared with a reference B. napus genotype, a total of 81 genera were significantly more abundant and 71 were significantly less abundant in at least one B. napus genotype out of the total 558 bacterial genera. Most differentially abundant genera were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria followed by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Here, we also show that B. napus genotypes select an overall core bacterial microbiome with growth-stage-related patterns as to how taxa joined the core membership. In addition, we report that sets of B. napus core taxa were consistent across our three sites and 2 years. Both differential abundance and core analysis implicate numerous bacteria that have been reported to have beneficial effects on plant growth including disease suppression, antifungal properties, and plant growth promotion. Using a multi-site year, temporally intensive field sampling approach, we showed that small plant genetic differences cause predictable changes in canola microbiome and are potential target for direct and indirect selection within breeding programs.},

Increasing crop diversity through rotation may alleviate these negative consequences by restoring positive aboveground–belowground interactions. Positive impacts of aboveground biodiversity on belowground communities and processes have primarily been observed in natural systems. Here, we test for the effects of increased diversity in an agroecosystem, where plant diversity is increased over time through crop rotation. As crop diversity increased from one to five species, distinct soil microbial communities were related to increases in soil aggregation, organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial activity and decreases in the carbon‐to‐nitrogen acquiring enzyme activity ratio. This study indicates positive biodiversity–function relationships in agroecosystems, driven by interactions between rotational and microbial diversity. By increasing the quantity, quality and chemical diversity of residues, high diversity rotations can sustain soil biological communities, with positive effects on soil organic matter and soil fertility.</p>},

   abstract = {Background: Crop rotation is an agronomic practice that is known to enhance productivity and yield, and decrease pest and disease pressure. Economic and other factors have increased the frequency of certain crops, including canola, with unknown effects on the below ground microbial communities that impact plant health and performance. This study investigated the effect of 12 years of crop rotation including canola-wheat; canola-pea-barley; and unrotated canola across three geographic sites in Western Canada with diverse soil types and environmental conditions. To provide data on mature, established crop rotation strategies, root exudate profiles, soil nutrient fluxes, and bacterial and fungal microbial community profiles were determined at the flowering stage in the final two (canola) years of the 12-year rotations. Results: After 12 years of rotation, nutrient fluxes were affected in the soil in an inconsistent manner, with K, NO3, Mg, Ca, P, and Fe fluxes variably impacted by rotation depending on the year and site of sampling. As expected, rotation positively influenced yield and oil content, and decreased disease pressure from Leptosphaeria and Alternaria. In two of the three sites, root exudate profiles were significantly influenced by crop rotation. Bacterial soil, root, and rhizosphere communities were less impacted by crop rotation than the fungal communities. Fungal sequences that were associated with specific rotation strategies were identified in the bulk soil, and included known fungal pathogens in the canola-only strategy. Two closely related fungal sequences identified as Olpidium brassicae were extremely abundant at all sites in both years. One of these sequences was observed uniquely at a single site and was significantly associated with monocropped canola; moreover, its abundance correlated negatively with yield in both years. Conclusions: Long-term canola monoculture affected root exudate profiles and soil nutrient fluxes differently in the three geographic locations. Bacterial communities were less impacted by rotation compared to the fungal communities, which consistently exhibited changes in composition in all ecological niches at all sites, in both years. Fungal sequences identified as O. brassicae were highly abundant at all sites, one of which was strongly associated with canola monoculture. Soil management decisions should include consideration of the effects on the microbial ecosystems associated with the plants in order to inform best management practices.},

   abstract = {Root exudates shape microbial communities at the plant-soil interface. Here we compared bacterial communities that utilize plant-derived carbon in the rhizosphere of wheat in different soil depths, including topsoil, as well as two subsoil layers up to 1 m depth. The experiment was performed in a greenhouse using soil monoliths with intact soil structure taken from an agricultural field. To identify bacteria utilizing plant-derived carbon, 13C-CO2 labelling of plants was performed for two weeks at the EC50 stage, followed by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation of extracted DNA from the rhizosphere combined with 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing. Our findings suggest substantially different bacterial key players and interaction mechanisms between plants and bacteria utilizing plant-derived carbon in the rhizosphere of subsoils and topsoil. Among the three soil depths, clear differences were found in 13C enrichment pattern across abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Whereas, OTUs linked to Proteobacteria were enriched in 13C mainly in the topsoil, in both subsoil layers OTUs related to Cohnella, Paenibacillus, Flavobacterium showed a clear 13C signal, indicating an important, so far overseen role of Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes in the subsoil rhizosphere.},

   abstract = {Agricultural intensification can involve the simplification of agroecosystems to crop monocultures while the practices of crop rotation, intercropping and companion planting maintain some crop diversity over time and space. It is generally postulated that reduced diversity can have an impact on ecosystem function. Here we determine whether decreased aboveground crop diversity affects belowground microbial biodiversity by conducting a meta-analysis of studies comparing monocultures and crop rotations. We based taxonomic richness and diversity indices on both molecular and biochemical fingerprinting methods. Soils under a higher diversity of crops in rotation produced higher microbial richness (+15.11%, n = 26) and diversity (+3.36%, n = 43) scores. This effect was significantly influenced by the proxy and methodology used where pyrosequencing produced higher richness scores compared to fingerprinting methods. Longer study trials produced larger increases in microbial richness, although the opposite was true for microbial diversity. The addition of legumes to rotation had no consistent effects on microbial diversity or richness. Whether the overall rotation-effect on microbial diversity promotes ecosystem functioning in terms of nutrient cycling and resilience to stress remains unclear. Future studies that incorporate next-generation sequencing techniques will help to elucidate complex microbial community structures and specific functional niches in agroecosystems.},

   abstract = {Although the importance of the soil microbiome in mediating plant community structures and functions has been increasingly emphasized in ecological studies, the biological processes driving crop diversity overyielding remain unexplained in agriculture. Based on the plant–soil feedback (PSF) theory and method, we quantified to what extent and how soil microbes contributed to intercropping overyielding. Soils were collected as inocula and sequenced from a unique 10-year field experiment, consisting of monoculture, intercropping and rotation planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays) or faba bean (Vicia faba). A PSF greenhouse study was conducted to test microbial effects on three crops' growth in monoculture or intercropping. In wheat & faba bean (W&F) and maize & faba bean (M&F) systems, soil microbes drove intercropping overyielding compared to monoculture, with 28%–51% of the overyielding contributed by microbial legacies. The overyielding effects resulted from negative PSFs in both systems, as crops, in particular faba bean grew better in soils conditioned by other crops than itself. Moreover, faba bean grew better in soils from intercropping or rotation than from the average of monocultures, indicating a strong positive legacy effect of multispecies cropping systems. However, with positive PSF and negative legacy benefit effect of intercropping/rotation, we did not observe significant overyielding in the W&M system. With more bacterial and fungal dissimilarities by metabarcoding in heterospecific than its own soil, the better it improved faba bean growth. More detailed analysis showed faba bean monoculture soil accumulated more putative pathogens with higher Fusarium relative abundance and more Fusarium oxysporum gene copies by qPCR, while in heterospecific soils, there were less pathogenic effects when cereals were engaged. Further analysis in maize/faba bean intercropping also showed an increase of rhizobia relative abundance. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate a soil microbiome-mediated advantage in intercropping through suppression of the negative PSF of pathogens and increasing beneficial microbes. As microbial mediation of overyielding is context-dependent, we conclude that the dynamics of both beneficial and pathogenic microbes should be considered in designing cropping systems for sustainable agriculture, particularly including combinations of legumes and cereals.},

   abstract = {Intensive cultivation based on monocultures has a significant impact on ecosystem function, and sustainable agriculture must rely on alternative methods, including crop rotation. On the Canadian prairies, the use of pulse crops is a common practice, but few studies have investigated the impact on soil microorganisms. Here, we studied the effect of pea, wheat, pea–wheat rotation, and fallow in bulk soil bacterial and fungal communities. We characterized soil microbiota by high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes for bacteria and eukaryotes. Different crop rotations and fallow significantly modified soil community composition, as well as bacterial and fungal diversity. Pea alone caused a strong reduction of bacterial and fungal richness and diversity compared to wheat, pea–wheat rotation, and fallow. Notably, pea–wheat rotation increased the abundance of Fusarium graminearum compared to other management practices. The bacterial community was less responsive to crop rotation identity compared to the fungal microbiota, and we found minor differences at the phylum level, with an increase in Actinobacteria in fallow and Firmicutes in wheat. In summary, our study demonstrated that rotations alter bulk soil microbial community diversity and composition in Canadian prairies. The frequent use of pea in rotation with wheat should be carefully evaluated, balancing their ecological effects on nitrogen mineralization, water conservation, and impact on beneficial, as well as pathotrophic, fungi.},

Here, barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA amplicons combined with phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis was applied to study the shifts in soil bacterial community structure and functional potentials in the rhizosphere of P. heterophylla under consecutive monoculture and different soil amendments (i.e., bio-organic fertilizer application [MF] and paddy-upland rotation [PR]). The results showed that the yield of tuberous roots decreased under P. heterophylla consecutive monoculture and then increased after MF and PR treatments, which was consistent with the changes in soil bacterial diversity. Both principal coordinate analysis and the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means cluster analysis showed the distinct difference in bacterial community structure between the consecutively monocultured soil (relatively unhealthy soil) and other relatively healthy soils (i.e., newly planted soil, MF, and PR). Furthermore, taxonomic analysis showed that consecutive monoculture of P. heterophylla significantly decreased the relative abundances of the families Burkholderiaceae and Acidobacteriaceae (subgroup 1), whereas it increased the population density of families Xanthomonadaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, and Alcaligenaceae, and Fusarium oxysporum. In contrast, the MF and PR treatments recovered the soil microbiome and decreased F. oxysporum abundance through the different ways; for example, the introduction of beneficial microorganisms (in MF) or the switching between anaerobic and aerobic conditions (in PR). In addition, PICRUSt analysis revealed the higher abundances of membrane transport, cell motility, and DNA repair in the consecutively monocultured soil, which might contribute to the root colonization and survival for certain bacterial pathogens under monoculture. These findings highlight the close association between replant disease of P. heterophylla and the variations in structure and potential functions of rhizosphere bacterial community.},

Here we examined bacterial communities across 684 samples from soils (rhizosphere and bulk soil) and multiple compartment niches (rhizoplane, root endosphere, phylloplane, and leaf endosphere) in maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum)/barley (Hordeum vulgare) rotation system under different fertilization practices at two contrasting sites. Our results demonstrate that microbiome assembly along the soil-plant continuum is shaped predominantly by compartment niche and host species rather than by site or fertilization practice. From soils to epiphytes to endophytes, host selection pressure sequentially increased and bacterial diversity and network complexity consequently reduced, with the strongest host effect in leaf endosphere. Source tracking indicates that crop microbiome is mainly derived from soils and gradually enriched and filtered at different plant compartment niches. Moreover, crop microbiomes were dominated by a few dominant taxa (c. 0.5% of bacterial phylotypes), with bacilli identified as the important biomarker taxa for wheat and barley and Methylobacteriaceae for maize. Our work provides comprehensive empirical evidence on host selection, potential sources and enrichment processes for crop microbiome assembly, and has important implications for future crop management and manipulation of crop microbiome for sustainable agriculture.},

Six group-specific methanogenic primer and probe sets were designed. These sets separately detect four orders (Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales) along with two families (Methanosarcinales and Methanosaetaceae) of the order Methanosarcinales. We also designed the universal primer and probe sets that specifically detect the 16S rDNA of prokaryotes and of the domain Bacteria and Archaea, and which are fully compatible with the TaqMan real-time PCR system. Target-group specificity of each primer and probe set was empirically verified by testing DNA isolated from 28 archaeal cultures and by analyzing potential false results. In general, each primer and probe set was very specific to the target group.

Here we show that agricultural soils under standard agricultural N-management are consistently characterized by a high presence of gene copies for some of the key biological activities related to the N-cycle. This led to a strong NO3- reduction (75%) passing from the soil surface (15.38 ± 11.36 g N-NO3 kg-1 on average) to the 1 m deep layer (3.92 ± 4.42 g N-NO3 kg-1 on average), and ensured low nitrate presence in the deepest layer. Under these circumstances the other soil properties play a minor role in reducing soil nitrate presence in soil. However, with excessive N fertilization, the abundance of bacterial gene copies is not sufficient to explain N leaching in soil and other factors, i.e. soil texture and rainfall, become more important in controlling these aspects.},
